# Expense-Tracker
A Java program that keeps track of a user's expenses and balance, with the option of saving and/or loading their data. My first project, built for UBC's CPSC 210 course.

## How to use the program

Upon running the program, the user can choose to change their name, manage their expenses list, or manage their wallet from the home page.

On the manage list page, the user can add an expense by entering the name in the first box and price in the second box, before pressing "Add Expense". To remove an expense, the user can type in the exact name of the item on the list, along with its price, before pressing "Remove Expense'.
 
Adding funds to the wallet can be done in the same fashion by entering the amount you want to add/remove and pressing the corresponding button.

Return to the main menu and press "Save" in the toolbar above to save your data. Alternatively, press "Load" in the toolbar above to load pre-existing data. Close the tab or select "Quit" to quit the program.
